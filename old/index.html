        <h3>first take</h3>
        <p>Hi, i am abk - well, erm… validating? that’s what i have "kinda" been going by online for several years now :P. It all started with xbox360 and here we are! You are probably wondering why you are even reading this, and honestly so am I. This is my second attempt to learn some code with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Project Odin.</a> (show off super basic link skills <a href="https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0">here<a>)</p>
        <p>While I learn new things - I want to continually add them into this main little blog/site/thing and who knows where it will go. Whenever I update or if I just feel like posting I will add a new entry. Whenever I do - I will always try to add a little story, sometimes it will be more in depth, sometimes a little dip like this first entry.</p>
        <p>So if you found this, hello… welcome 2 our journey…note this is basic html nothing else at the time of posting</p>
